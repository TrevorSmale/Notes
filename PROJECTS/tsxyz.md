## A new personal website

I am currently using a square space hosted site for portfolio presentation. The plan is to build out a site that is far more customized and full featured.

### Technical Overview

My original plan was to use HUGO, a static site generator. However, I quickly realized that static sites are more suited to the written word and simple templating. While studying the features of Golang, I learned that go can package projects into a single binary file including all dependency files. Furthermore, I learned that REACT front end javascript framework can be neatly packaged.

I found this tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Rv_3-FF0g&t=852s) that details how to create a Vite + React page and package it into a single Go Binary.

I have successfully created the project structure on the development branch of my repo, displaying the demo page.
