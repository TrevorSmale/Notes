# Web Assembly
## .WAT A statically compiled language that is able to use hardware acceleration to have near native performance in the browswer

WASM will revolutionize the web as it allows for complex, performance intensive programs to load and run with normal web tools.
WASM is treated like a compilation target wherein a codebase made with many different languages eg. C++ + RUST can compile to .WAT.
For example the entire AutoCAD codebase was compiled to Web Assembly and works perfectly within a browser.
