## Notes outlighting the traits of a well rounded web developer 

A well rounded web developer has an understanding of the scope and function of a web project, meaning they are able to manage a given technology stack. Web projects require the use of a (Front-End) and a (Back-End) in order to store and display information. Furthermore, both the front and back end comprise groupings of technologies that cooperate. 

## Solid understanding of the fundamentals HTML5, CSS3 and JS E6

* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, it is markup/scripting language used to arrange the elements of a website. Version 5 of HTML features new tags that enable more sophisticated elements like links lists, form submissions, accessibility features etc...

* CSS3 stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is used to stylize the various elements of a website. CSS version 3 brings further sophistication to the markup/scripting language that enable global variables, animations, responsiveness and scripting.

* Javascript E6 is a scripting language that enables elements of a site to become reactive to user input. A time, scroll of the mouse or text input can summon a scripted response or change to the page, therefore it reacts.
