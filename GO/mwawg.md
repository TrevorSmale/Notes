# Course Notes

## Making Modern Web Applications with Go

# What we are going to do

* Learn the fundamentals of the GO programming language
* Build a web application using Golang
* Learn how to deploy to a live server

# What tech stack we are going to use

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Go
* PostgreSQL

# What the project will comprise

Creating a functional bed and breakfast website with several interactive pages, event handlers and live info panels. The application will also have an administrator backend with user authentication for managing information on the website. We will also be creating tests in order to confirm the function of the code. Mistakes will be made, but we will create a great functional project.

# Why Go and not PHP, Python or Node.js

Nothing wrong with other tools. However Go has significant advantages:

* It compiles to a single binary
* No runtimes to worry about
* Statically typed, so no surprises at run time
* Object oriented (sort of) using interfaces
* Concurrency
* Cross platform
* Excellent package management & testing built in!
* Built in production ready webserver

# Why go (System Resources)

Golang uses:

* Far less system resources
* Tiny memory footprint
* Tiny CPU load
* More uptime

# Installation and setup

Install Go 'Many options' already done
Install VSCode
Install the go extension for VSCODE from the extension marketplace
Bring up command pallete and search GO: install/update Tools
